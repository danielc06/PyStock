# PyStock

The API key that's missing in RunMain.py can be obtained for free from https://iextrading.com/developer/.

The UI was created using PyQt5.

This is a simple project that I developed as I started getting interested in the stock market.

I had no prior Python experience going into this and I wanted to use this as an excuse to dig 
further into Python.
